    "Information retrieval is defined as a completely automated procedure that answers to a user query by reviewing a group of documents and producing a sorted document list that ought to be relevant to the user's query criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information retrieval process can be divided into four distinct phases: indexing,\n",
    "querying, comparison, and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "IR is widely used in various applications such as search engines, question answering systems, and recommendation systems. It has become increasingly important with the growth of digital information, which has made it challenging for users to find relevant information efficiently and effectively."

    "- **Boolean model:** In the Boolean model, a query is represented as a Boolean expression of terms, and a document is either relevant or non-relevant to the query. This model is simple and efficient, but it can be too restrictive and may not account for partial matches or term frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector space model:** In the vector space model, a document is represented as a vector of term weights, and a query is represented as a vector of term weights as well. The similarity between the query vector and each document vector is computed using a similarity measure, such as cosine similarity. This model is flexible and can handle partial matches and term frequency, but it may suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality\" and may require normalization and tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probabilistic model:** In the probabilistic model, a document is ranked based on the probability of relevance given the query, which is computed using Bayes' theorem. This model is more robust than the Boolean model and can handle partial matches and term frequency, but it may require tuning and may be sensitive to the choice of priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language model:** In the language model, a query is modeled as a language model, which is a probability distribution over terms, and a document is modeled as a language model as well. The relevance of a document to a query is measured using the likelihood ratio of the document language model under the query language model and the background language model. This model is effective in handling uncertainty and partial matches, but it may require tuning and may be sensitive to the choice of smoothing methods."
